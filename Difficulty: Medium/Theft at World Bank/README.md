He decides to carry a sack with him, which can carry a maximum weight of <strong>c</strong> kgs. Inside the world bank there were <strong>n</strong> large blocks of gold. All the blocks have some profit value associated with them<em> i.e.</em> if he steals <strong>i<sup>th</sup></strong> block of weight <strong>w[i]</strong> then he will have <strong>p[i] </strong>profit. As blocks were heavy he decided to steal some part of them by cutting them&nbsp;with his cutter.<br>The thief does not like symmetry, hence, he wishes to not take blocks or parts of them whose weight is a perfect square. Now, you need to find out the maximum profit that he can earn given that he can only carry blocks of gold in his sack.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Note</strong>: The answer should be precise upto 3 decimal places.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Examples :</strong></span></p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;">n = 3, c = 10, w[] = {4, 5, 7}, p[] = {8, 5, 4)
<strong>Output: </strong>
7.857
<strong>Explanation: </strong>As first blocks weight is 4 which is a perfect square, he will not use this block. Now with the remaining blocks the most optimal way is to use 2<sup>nd</sup> block completely and cut 5kg piece from the 3<sup>rd</sup> block to get a total profit of 5 + 2.857 = 7.857</span></pre>
